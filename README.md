# python_ttt

This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python done as a test task. 

Current version notes:
- Needs pytest testing:
    - Needs to break out more out of loop, or test the whole thing somehow
    - More detailed:
        - Printing board [DONE]
        - Placing a piece, printing [DONE, badly - need to stop relying on code copied from main loop]
        - Taking a turn [NOT DONE]
        - Preventing cheating [NOT DONE]
        - Handling unexpected input [NOT DONE]
        - Checking win conditions [NOT DONE]
        - Checking draw [NOT DONE]
- Needs a smarter way to test conditions?
